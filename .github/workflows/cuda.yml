    # Cuda version
    cuda: # optional, default is 12.3.2
    # Only installs specified subpackages, must be in the form of a JSON array. For example, if you only want to install nvcc and visual studio integration: ["nvcc", "visual_studio_integration"] double quotes required! Note that if you want to use this on Linux, 'network' method MUST be used.
    sub-packages: # optional, default is []
    # Only installs specified subpackages that do not have the cuda prefix, must be in the form of a JSON array. For example, if you only want to install libcublas and libcufft: ["libcublas", "libcufft"] double quotes required! Note that this only works with 'network' method on only on Linux.
    non-cuda-sub-packages: # optional, default is []
    # Installation method, can be either 'local' or 'network'. 'local' downloads the entire installer with all packages and runs that (you can still only install certain packages with sub-packages on Windows). 'network' downloads a smaller executable which only downloads necessary packages which you can define in subPackages
    method: # optional, default is local
    # (Linux and 'local' method only) override arguments for the linux .run installer. For example if you don't want samples use ["--toolkit"] double quotes required!
    linux-local-args: # optional, default is ["--toolkit", "--samples"]
    # Use GitHub cache to cache downloaded installer on GitHub servers
    use-github-cache: # optional, default is true
    # Use local cache to cache downloaded installer on the local runner
    use-local-cache: # optional, default is true
    # Suffix of log file name in artifact
    log-file-suffix: # optional, default is log.txt
